The Kp index reached 4 during the periods 2014-04-30T06:00Z-09:00Z and 12:00Z-15:00Z due to an extended period of southward interplanetary magnetic field possibly from a transient.

For 36 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- Mars between about 2014-04-21T06:36Z and 2014-04-22T04:07Z (average arrival 2014-04-21T14:19Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2014-04-20T01:05Z and 2014-04-20T11:15Z (average arrival 2014-04-20T05:07Z) for 100% of simulations.

A CME arrival was also detected at STEREO A on 2014-04-09T13:00Z due possibly to the arrival of the CME with ID 2014-04-06T09:48Z.  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period.  The highest value (Kp=4) occurred on the synoptic periods of 2014-04-05T09:00Z-12:00Z and 2014-04-07T15:00Z-18:00Z.  These increase in geomagnetic activity were caused by the arrival of the CME with ID 2014-04-02T13:55Z, and slightly elevated solar wind speeds starting on 2014-04-07. \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe flux of 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO B exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2014-04-02T15:55Z. This solar energetic particle event was associated with the M6.5 class flare with ID 2014-04-02T13:18Z and its associated CME with ID 2014-04-02T13:55Z (see notification 20140402-AL-002).  The 13-100 MeV energetic protons detected at STEREO A were at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES were slightly elevated on 2014-04-05 due to the CME arrival described above.  \n\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the CME arrival described above.  \n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2014-04-02  13:18:00  14:28:00  14:05:00   M6.5   N12E53 ( 12027 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2014-04-02T13:55Z     ~1604           O               -50/19                68                          STEREO B, SOHO, STEREO A   \n     \nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)    \n2014-04-03T04:54Z     ~509            C               -65/42                15                          STEREO B, SOHO, STEREO A          \n2014-04-06T09:48Z     ~654            C               145/26                40                          SOHO, STEREO A, STEREO B          \n2014-04-07T21:28Z     ~510            C               124/-32               37                          SOHO, STEREO A, STEREO B          \n2014-04-08T11:12Z     ~525            C               156/40                40                          SOHO, STEREO A, STEREO B          \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2014-04-09T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2014-04-15T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week.  There are currently no solar active regions with history of significant recent flaring activity.  Based on heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center it is estimated that the CME with ID 2014-04-08T11:12Z may impact MESSENGER at about 2014-04-09T02:46Z and STEREO A at about 2014-04-11T16:53Z (plus or minus 7 hours).   The CME with ID 2014-04-09T00:00Z is estimated to arrive at STEREO B at about 2014-04-11T20:35Z (plus or minus 7 hours).   \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n" }]
